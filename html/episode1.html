      <h2>Ep 1: "We Meet Aoki Pink"</h2>
      <h2 style="color: #4D6FBC; left: 62px; z-index: 1; position: absolute;">Ep 1: "We Meet Aoki Pink"</h2>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span></span> Have you ever heard something and thought: “Damn.” It’s the kind of song, or passage, or, in my case, a poem that feels almost gut wrenching because of how true it feels. It’s how I feel when I read Maya Angelou or Pablo Neruda. And it’s what I felt when I first heard a poem by Aoki Pink, –a poet I’ve gotten to know over several months of calls made from my dorm room at Barnard College in New York City to a homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles, where Aoki currently lives. I study literature here at Barnard, but I am, admittedly, not usually drawn to poetry. Poems often feel abstract, like puzzles with no reference picture to go off from. Yet, Aoki’s poetry feels different. It’s rooted in realness. In life, love, struggle, and our nation’s most pertinent injustices. Take a Listen.</p>
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span></span> <br>
      Hour by hour <br>
      Our pages fold down flags of many <br>
      nations and flout, doggedly <br>
      determined bills and petitions. <br>
      Overturned vindications back to <br>
      convictions. Turn by turn, after <br>
      divided terms, biologically, bi-partisan <br>
      pestilence. <br>
      Written and weighed down <br>
      by history’s regret. Blotted out <br>
      and emaciated by blight water <br>
      logged, dry rotted foundations. <br>
      All the dams be damned <br>
      by the Treasury. The common <br>
      wealth is drowning. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span></span> This is Aoki, a podcast detailing one man’s journey through a criminal justice system that disproportionately affects transgender and gender nonconforming people, people of color, and low income communities, and how he used art to heal. I’m Daniela Miranda. I connected with Aoki through a mutual creative writing mentor and, being drawn to his art and his story, began to document our phone calls with his permission. This is his story of homelessness, incarceration, and finding hope in the power of poetry.
      Jingle fades out.</p> 


      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span></span> When I was growing up in the 80s, it was like gangs and stuff. And the street life was really getting poppin. You know, when I was little, Cheetos was in a blue bag. Like, it wasn't an orange bag.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span></span> Oh wow.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> Those were in a blue bag, and I'm an 80s baby, you know what I mean? My bus was $1.10. I grew up in the era of starter jackets, N.W.A, Cross Colors. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> And I loved school. Like, I loved getting up to catch the school bus to go to school,  to learn and to be with other kids because my sister is 12 years older than me. So it's like I had two moms. It wasn't like having another brother and sister, I had somebody else telling me what to do. You know, so it was good to be at school, so my mom, she raised me and my sister by herself, you know, single mom, single Black mom. Strong. Living in a neighborhood trying to do her best to take care of two girls, you know?</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> Aoki was born in South Central L.A. on March 22, 1984. He was raised by his single mom, a lab technician at Cedar Sinai Hospital, and an older sister. He loved school, basketball, and frequenting the local record store to check out up-and-coming rappers and r&b music. As a kid, Aoki tested into a magnet school, got good grades, and had dreams of going to college on a basketball scholarship—life seemed promising for Aoki. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> My mom in the household she had us read and she was cultured, and she taught us about, you know, there's a life outside of this environment, don't be a product of your environment. Do more, seek more, learn more, want more. But it's like, sometimes your environment will engulf you. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> Then, when he started coming to terms with his gender and his sexuality, everything changed. </p>


      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> I was born a girl and everything, but I was always just, I guess mischievious or rambunctious because my sister was always trying to stop me from climbing on stuff jumping up and down, getting dirty, keep your hands out of your pocket always had this little thing going on about myself, I've always been a tomboy. So I never really was into, you know, what I was supposed to be into.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> I've always felt out of place. Like there was something wrong with me. From eight years old, my mom came into my room and was like, ‘Why do you want to collect basketball cards so much?’ Or, ‘Why are you, why are you so into this so much?’ I was like, ‘I don't know, this is what I like.’And she just couldn't understand. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> I was raised in a Christian home, and because of my sexuality, I was pushed out of my household. And that began my path, you know, I guess to deviancy. Or just, messing up.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> Being raised in a traditional Christian household, coming out wasn’t an option for Aoki. Experiencing gender dysphoria was something he was taught, from an early age, to suppress and correct.</p>


      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> <br>
      Reminiscent of turmoil and <br>
      triumphantly descriptive of <br>
      neutered courage, muted passion, <br>
      and sanctimonious contradiction. <br>
      How do the impoverished <br>
      owe pennance when salvation <br>
      is free? We pass around <br>
      crumbs and beg your pardon for <br>
      the fullness of leavened <br>
      bread. <br>
      We starve our person of <br>
      individuality so we can fit into<br>
      state blues; juggling our hopes <br>
      and dreams in and out of <br>
      one pocket. 
      </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> So when you came out—you came out at 16—is that when you were turned out of your house? </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> Well, I was kind of pulled out of the closet, because I tell you, we went to church. My mom praises the Lord, it was about God, you have to follow the rules in this Bible, and go to school and get good grades. This is what it is for you. And so, um, you know, my mom was concerned, like, “You've been wearing, you've been wearing these jeans and everything,” and I got a summer job. I was an office clerk, you know, at the job that my mom worked at through this program, JTPA. And so I had my own money. And at the time, I knew who my dad was. At this particular time, I was getting ready to go, you know, to high school and he didn't want to buy my school clothes. But I had a summer job. So I bought my own clothes. And since it was my money, I bought what I wanted to buy. And I didn't buy any dresses. And I bought like, you know, boxers, you know, ‘slingshots,’ we call ‘em. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> But I hid them, you know, because I didn't want my mom to see me like that and I kind of like, introduced them to her like, ‘Oh, these are for basketball practice.’</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> “And my mom couldn't couldn't understand why I wouldn't take my money and go get like lip gloss or press on nails. And that was the furthest thing from my mind. I wanted to pack of basketball cards and, like, you know me, some candy from the store… But, you know, she just didn't understand that.”</p>

      <p>And then one morning, she was like, ‘You couldn't put on a dress,’ you know? And I'm like, ‘No, I'm not putting that dress on. I don't have to put that on. I bought this. I bought this. You didn't buy it.” Like nobody did that for me, you know, and my mom was upset. And so I had to, like, run out of the back door real fast and I ran to the bus stop. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> And basically, I went to school, told my counselor what was going on, she called the house –My parent, my sister was upset. My mom was upset, they called her and she was saying all kinds of stuff out of anger. And basically, one day I went into the system. And I just didn't come home for a while. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> Aoki told me that, prior to this, he had confided in his older sister about his identity. He thought she would be understanding, empathetic even, but she ended up tipping off their mom. After then, Aoki’s mother only became more wary of his masculinity– a wariness which finally erupted that regular weekday morning Aoki refused to wear a dress to school.</p>


      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> And I tried to go live with my dad and he wasn't tripping on me that I wanted to wear overalls, jeans, and tennis shoes. When I went to his house for those three days, he was cool and like, I felt like, for the first time in my life, I was gonna have a chance to get to know my dad. And I was comfortable at his house, and I loved being under him. It hurt my feelings because my mom called him and goes, you know, “She's trying to be gay, she's gay.” And so he brought my clothes back to my mom's house, like, “Ugh, I don't want you.” And it broke my spirit because I had asked both of them, “Could I go to basketball camp?” And I was upset, because it's like, “You guys couldn't call each other on the phone and co-parent to put money together so I could go to basketball camp, but you guys get on the phone and join forces to kick me out?” Lord, you know, it was fucked up—excuse me. I was really angry in my adolescence. You know, I was mad at every adult around me and I always felt ejected and rejected.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> I wanted my mom to be happy with me. I wanted my mom to be pleased with me, I wanted my mom to love me. I didn't want my mom to be mad at me. I didn't want to get a whopping. You know, I wanted us to have fun, you know, and her to love me. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> According to a 2017 (twenty seventeen) study conducted by the University of Chicago, Black or African American youth are 83% (eighty-three percent) more likely to experience homelessness than other ethnic groups. And LGBTQ+ youth? They’re at risk of experiencing homelessness at a rate 120% (one hundred twenty percent) higher than non-LGBTQ+ youth. Being rejected by caretakers or loved ones is the study’s most cited reason for why LGBTQ+ youth experience homelessness (True Colors United Organization). </p>


      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> So, what happened when you got back to your mom’s? </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> Well, she was like, “You can’t stay here like that”... So, I called my friend, one of my best friends at the time, her name is Jessica. And she let me come to her house until I figured out where I was going to go or what I was going to do. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> But at first, my friends, they couldn't understand it either, you know? Especially my friend Jessica, she couldn't understand it at first and I was a loner. You know, I was already a loner. But I was at a point where I was like, “You know what, hey, fuck everybody. I'm just gonna be me,” you know? </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> After that, I was just living in a group home in Hollywood and then soon they sent me to a group home in Echo Park. And, um, I was, you know, trying to make it through school. But at this point, I was drinking and smoking weed. But I was drinking a lot more. I started really, like, having this thing for a drink. Because it was easing my pain. And then, in class, I was just acting like an asshole. I was only showing up for classes that I wanted to show up. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> I was rebelling because it was like, “You're going to hell because you're gay.” So I was like, “I'm going to hell anyway. So I might as well just do whatever I want to do.” </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> Aoki ended up dropping out of Hamilton Magnet school in the 11th grade. At this point, he had transitioned to a group home in Hollywood, and started attending Hollywood Adult School. During his time there, he met a girl and started hanging around Hollywood boulevard –where he would drink, smoke weed, and steal to get by. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> We would walk the boulevard and we had our little cuts that we would go smoke weed, you know, and rapping. I thought I was just the shit. I had this confidence about myself because I was dressing how I wanted to dress and girls were attracted to me and we had this thing called the party line we could call, you had a name, you know, I used to call myself ‘Dynamite Knockout,’ aka handsome kid, you know, press number three or something to chat, or whatever we was doing on a party line. So I thought I was a player, you know– </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> –And I was a thief. (Chuckling) If it wasn’t nailed down, I was gonna get it–  </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> Cause I had to take care of myself. If I didn't have money I had to do what I had to do –to look good, smell good, and stay clean. And the thrill of that, it wears off. Because when you sober up, and you sit there and you think and you feel your feelings, I was just scared. I was just a kid scared, and wanted love and acceptance. I just wanted my mom to love me and accept me for who I was and support me so I could go, you know, to school and go to college. I just wanted to dress how I wanted to dress and my mom was not having it. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> No longer under the roof of a traditional Christian household, Aoki was finally able to present himself as he had always wanted to. Still, living on the streets came with its own challenges.</p> 

      <p>Forced to live in public spaces, people experiencing homelessness are at higher risk of interacting with the criminal justice system. The relationship between prisons and homeless shelters is often referred to as a “revolving door” as, not only are formerly incarcerated people 10 times more likely to be homeless than the general population, but homeless people are also more likely to be targeted by the police (Prison Policy Initiative).</p>  

      <p>“Public nuisance” crimes, including camping, loitering, and public urination, directly criminalize homelessness, and make it difficult for those facing homelessness to avoid the prison system. According to the National HCH (or Health Care for the Homeless) Council, having a history of homelessness is 7.5 to 11.3 times more likely among the prison population than the general population (National HCH Council).</p> 

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> My big brother Will, and Dayaye, and Will's baby mom, Melody, they took me in and made sure that I have a roof over my head, like I didn't have to sleep on the street too many nights and I asked them if I needed to shower, take a shower and get dressed and I was like pillar to post. And then I got a job under the table at security. You know? I was living in my neighborhood. I grew up off of West Boulevard. You know, off of Crenshaw Hyde Park and I used to hang out on West Boulevard. That was my everyday, you know, stomping grounds. I used to visit the liquor store every day at 6am, every day that God sent, till the day I was like 18, 19. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> So that was my routine, I would get up and I would hang out and we would get faded, like, we would get dust. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> And we would rap because the only thing I had left was words. And poetry was free </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> Homeless youth, in particular, are at high risk of partaking in risky behavior on the streets, with 20-30% of unstably housed young people having arrest histories and about 150,000 entering the criminal justice system annually (National HCH Council). Yet, since formerly incarcerated people face discrimination when seeking employment and housing, it makes it even harder for them to re-enter society. </p>

      <p>Ever since being kicked out of his family home as a teenager, Aoki too has been caught up in this revolving door.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> So right now I'm in the shelter. I'm in the Weingart Center for the homeless, which is downtown LA. So it's like re–entry housing, kind of, kind of like a half-way program within another program for the homeless. I'm really grateful for it because, you know, otherwise, I’d just be outside on the streets. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> I was reluctant to live in this area, because it's so hard, like, this is like ground zero, you know what I mean? Either it’s going to make you or is going to take you or break you. Like those three things. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> The area Aoki is referring to is Skid Row, which is known to serve as a place of respite for both impoverished artists and POC. Nicknamed the “homeless capital of the United States,”
      researchers estimate that “28 to 60 percent” of the Skid Row population “suffer from mental [health issues]” and “30 to 80 percent have drug and alcohol addictions” (Stuart). </p>

      <p>Here’s an archival clip from a 2018 Al Jazeera news story which sent a journalist to Skid Row shortly after the neighborhood became the focus of a report written by the United Nations on extreme poverty:</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reporter:</span> It’s really hard to describe how difficult the circumstances are for living out here in Skid Row. There are so many people who are battling mental illness. A lot of people got triggered just by seeing us with our cameras.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Resident:</span> You’re gonna get your a** killed on Skid Row about that camera.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reporter:</span> We’ve seen syringes in the street. We’ve seen feces in the street. You can smell the lack of sanitation. So, not only is this a major homeless crisis, it’s a public health crisis and a mental health crisis too.”</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> Apart from the neighborhood’s troubling living conditions, there’s its unusually high crime rate. Skid Row is policed about 69 times more than the rest of Los Angeles (Stuart). In 2006 and 2007 alone, 18,000 arrests were made in the neighborhood, though it only had 15,000 residents at the time. Many more citations were issued for littering, jay-walking, and sitting on the sidewalk—just the kind of policies which disproportionately affect homeless residents (Stuart). Aoki, who has been in and out of Skid Row since he was 18 years old, hopes one day he might save enough money to make it out of the neighborhood and live on his own. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> I just want to move to an area where I'm seeing something different that I've never seen. I can't take credit for this, you know, Lionel Richie has a song called “Zoom.” That song, he has a line in it, and he goes about horizons that he may never see, you know what I mean? It's like I'm trying to get to some of those horizons and see them.</p> 

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> What I’ve realized by talking to Aoki is that sometimes he speaks in song lyrics, connecting to the words profoundly, finding analogies in them to his own life. Sometimes he’ll send me song recommendations after we chat. LL Cool J, Common, Ludacris —artists I, admittedly, know by name, but not by their discography. The reason he’s an R&B connoisseur, I figure, is because he’s good at recognizing when words tap at something true. Here’s the rest of the poem you’ve been hearing throughout this episode, AT 1600 by Aoki Pink.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> <br>
      We fly kites low to the <br>
      ground because there isn’t air enough <br>
      to breathe, let alone share. <br>
      Hour by hour every 1600 hours <br>
      I’m chained there with you. <br>
      Hour by hour every 1600 hours <br>
      I’m chained there with you. <br>
      Deserving of truth, affection, <br>
      joy, and respect. <br>
      Hour by hour they neglect, <br>
      deceive, pat down, and undress <br>
      the ghost writers of their <br>
      paychecks. No body, no watch. <br>
      Hour by hour they continue <br>
      to bite our hands. </p>

      <div style="height: 3px; background-color: #F9A52A;"></div>
      <br>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> Next time, we delve deep into Aoki’s time in prison, – </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> Could I ask you? How did you feel about being at a women’s prison? </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> Because I’m attracted to women– </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Both:</span> (Laughter) </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #BC94FF;">Aoki:</span> You know, there’s an old saying that goes, “Being happy as a sissy at a CC Camp,” back in my mother’s generation, so I wasn’t bothered at all. I know biologically, whatever, you know, is biological, but it didn’t bother me at all. I’m queer. And that’s a whole spectrum. Being in prison is miserable, so you have to find some type of happiness.  </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> –meet the woman who brought Aoki and I together, </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #59B0CC;">Katie:</span> People who are incarcerated have, they experienced sensory deprivation on every single level, and it's intentional,– </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #59B0CC;">Katie:</span> That level of sensory deprivation is extreme, and it has very severe consequences, psychological consequences on people. But when you use your creative imagination, and over the past decade, there have been a lot of studies that have shown that, by igniting imagination in the brain, the brain actually believes in that, kind of, almost time and space travel. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> – and find out something unexpected. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #59B0CC;">Katie:</span> Did he already tell you a little bit about– </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #4D6FBC;">Daniela:</span> Not about you two meeting, no, not yet. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #59B0CC;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #59B0CC;">Katie:</span></span> It’s such a crazy story. So– </p>
